Using the Parse database, I made an application where users can register to the application and then share the name of the places they like while travelling on holiday or on a touristic trip, the effect it leaves on the person, the photo and the location in a way that other users can see.
Features in my app: 

1- I created a database where I saved users and users' information using Parse
2- I enabled users to use the application with the user login and sign-up system.
3- Using the Map feature, I enabled the user to save the desired locations with the pin and create a route there.
4- I developed a system where you can upload images, enter information and all these are open to everyone with a table view.
As a result, I realised a foursquare clone application.
